ðŸ”„ Spread Operator in JavaScript â€“ Use Cases
1. Function Argument Passing

Uses the spread operator (...) to pass array elements as individual arguments to a function.

2. Combining Arrays (Array Literals)

Merges multiple arrays (Morning, Afternoon, Night) into a single array using spread syntax.

Includes a conditional element ('watermelon') based on a boolean flag (issummer).

3. Merging Objects (Object Literals)

Combines properties of two objects (car and carinfo) into a new object using spread syntax.

Highlights the downside of Object.assign() which mutates the original object.

Shows how spread avoids mutation and also allows for value overrides (e.g., changing CarColour to 'white').
